# About

Amelie-theme is a Emacs 24 theme with dard background and bright colorful foreground.
Inspired by the [Slim](http://slim-lang.org) main page.

# Attention

It is `Amelie` not `amelie`. Never forget the beautiful uppercase!

# Installation

Emacs 24 will find the theme file whose name ends with `-theme.el`
under the directory defined by variable `custom-theme-load-path`.
Default directory is `~/.emacs.d/`.

Download `Amelie-theme.el` to the directory `~/.emacs.d/themes/` and add this to your
`.emacs`:

`(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")`

Now you can load the theme with like this:

`M-x load-theme RET Amelie`
